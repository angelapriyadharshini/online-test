# online-test
An online test platform to test your knowledge

This is a web application for skill testing. The main purpose of this application is to initiate online testing of programming languages. Users receive an email to confirm the registration process. The application provides with login functionality for three types of users,
1. Candidate
2. Recruiter
3. Admin
The candidate is able to explore and sit for the test of his/her desired skill. Each test is built with a random set of questions with a time limit. The candidates are required to finish within the time. They can mark the unanswered questions and answer at the end of the test. After finishing the test the candidate gets the results immediately. 
The recruiters are allowed to create custom tests and also able to assign available tests to the candidates by inviting them with their email id. Once the candidates complete the test, recruiters are updated with the test results.
The Admin level user has the full control over the application. He/She is able to remove any user in case of a valid reason. The test content and all the data on the application are verified by the admin and is allowed to add or remove any notifications and other authorized information.
